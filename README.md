# ansible

My custom ansible homeserver files. I used these documents for my personal homelab dedicated to ansible training.

Just storing the files here. Feel free to view the image as proof of my project completion.

If you view the tasks folder, you will notice a main_edited.yml, this is because I was suggested in using a when function to minimize task yml usage to a single yml.
However, I quite enjoy the specifying "fedora" or "debian" phase of the yml so I've reverted back to my preferential method.

But yeah, feel free to dig around.
